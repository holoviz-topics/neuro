## Why does Neuroscience need HoloViz+Bokeh?

We hypothesize the process of science stands to benefit from having the option to suddenly become interactive and shareable - allowing for the poking or plucking, pushing or pulling, drilling in or out, grouping or separating, and sending or receiving of what would otherwise be a static snapshot of the data. The combined use of HoloViz and Bokeh tools could provide the interactivity, shareability, and scalability needed to support research as a collective action rather than a collection of solitary observations.

### What is the purpose of this GitHub repository?

One of our overall goals is to facilitate the creation of fully open, reproducible,
OS-independent, browser-based workflows for biomedical research primarily using
sustainable, domain-independent visualization tools. In support of this
goal, this repository is the **development ground for optimization of
[HoloViz](https://github.com/holoviz/) and [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) tools within the realm of neuroscience.**

**Specific Repo objectives:**
  
- **Workflow Development:** Host the development versions of workflows, facilitating consistency and code sharing across them.
- **Collaboration Hub:** Foster collaborative efforts between the developer teams and scientific collaborators outside these groups - aiming to effectively tailor development to specific requirements of the neuroscience community.
- **Project Management:** Track ideas, feedback, requirements, specifications, issues, requests, topic research, and progress.
- **Host Domain-Specific Scripts:** For instance, simulated data generators.
- **Temporarily Host Benchmark Tooling:** Eventually, to be be migrated to a dedicated, domain-independent repository.

## Dissemination
- Workflows will be shared with the broader scientific community as they are ready. The first round of workflows were released at the end of 2024. Completed workflows will be listed on the [HoloViz Examples Gallery](https://examples.holoviz.org/gallery/neuroscience.html), while select aspects will also go into the relevant Bokeh and HoloViz documentation pages.
- Workflow progress was be presented at the [CZI open science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/open-science/) conference in Boston, MA in June 2024. 
- If you have ideas for where our workflows could be promoted, please reach out! We would love it if there was also a central place for bioscience workflows, like the Geoscience community has with [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/).

## Installation for individual workflows with Conda

### Prerequisites
Before installing the workflow environments, make sure you have Miniconda installed. If not, you can download and install it from the [official site]([https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/index.html#quick-command-line-install)).

### Initial Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the `neuro` repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/holoviz-topics/neuro.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Workflow**: Change to the directory of the workflow you're interested in.
    ```bash
    cd neuro/workflows/<workflow>
    ```

3. **Create Environment**: Use `conda` to create a new environment from the `environment.yml` file.
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

4. **Activate Environment**: After the environment is created, activate it.
    ```bash
    conda activate <environment>
    ```


### Updating Workflow Environments

If you've already installed a workflow environment and the `environment.yml` file has been updated, follow these steps to update the environment:

1. **Update Repository**: Pull the latest changes from the repository.
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

2. **Navigate to Workflow**: Go to the directory of the workflow you're interested in.
    ```bash
    cd neuro/workflows/<workflow>
    ```

3. **Update Environment**: Update the existing Conda environment based on the latest `environment.yml` file.
    ```bash
    conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
    ```

The `--prune` option will remove packages from the environment not present in the updated `environment.yml` file.

## Resources for Contributing

- **Task Management:** As workflows are developed and honed, performance and UI bottlenecks will be identified and addressed. Some improvements for the workflows themselves will be within this repo, but many improvements will be in the appropriate underlying libraries within the [HoloViz](https://github.com/holoviz/), [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh), or other GitHub Organizations. We will do our best to track the disparate tasks related to these efforts into this 
[project board](https://github.com/orgs/holoviz-topics/projects/1).
- **Communication:** 
  - [HoloViz Discord #neuro channel](https://discord.gg/X6Eq9CvZZn) for real-time chat (if archived, post on the General HoloViz Discord channel)
  - [holoviz-topics/neuro GitHub repo issue
    tracker](https://github.com/holoviz-topics/neuro/issues)
- **Repo Structure and dev patterns:** 
    ```
    /workflows
      /example1
        readme_example1.md
        workflow_example1.ipynb
        environment.yml
        /dev
            date_example-workflow_task.ipynb
    ```
  - Use `readme_<workflow>.md` for any essential workflow-specific info or links.
  - Maintain `workflow_<workflow>.ipynb` as the latest version of the workflow.
  - Each workflow should have an `environment.yml` with which to create a conda env
